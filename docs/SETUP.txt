SETUP DECO JAVASCRIPTS
======================
Deco uses requirejs[1] and almondjs[2] via plone.app.toolbar/plone.app.widgets.

As such, several parts of the code are broken down into AMD (Asynchronous
Module Definition) style modules, which are later combined to form a single
bundle.

The bundle is created as:

    plone/app/deco/resources/src/deco.js

The bundle is created by issuing a make command from the
_plone/app/deco/resources/src/_ directory, like so:

    $ cd /path/to/plone/app/deco/resources/src/
    $ make bootstrap
    $ make

Note: it is expected that you have npm/nodejs installed at the moment

The `make bootstrap` command downloads all the appropriate node modules and
sets up all the appropriate commands needed (mostly testing related). If you
create a 'build' directory manually, then you'd only need to issue the `make`
command to actually combine all the separate modules.

After you issue the `make` command you'll need to copy the resulting deco.js
from the _plone/app/deco/resources/src/build/_ directory into the 
_plone/app/deco/resources/src/_ directory, overwritting any existing file.
